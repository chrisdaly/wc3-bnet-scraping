# wc3_bnet_scraping
Scrapes a player's profile and returns JSON. Utilized with AWS API Gateway as the Lambda function.

## TODO
Scrape everything on the page.
Replace "rank": null with N/A.
Keep only numbers, let downstream format to string etc. Check what twitter does here.
More defined endpoints.
Start incorporating twitch bot.
